This repository contains files CSCI 127 (Joy and Beauty of Data). This is the entry level computer science course at Montana State University.

I took this class as a freshman and currently a Course Assistant. I keep the files for these respective roles seperated, hence the directories: Student and CourseAssistant.

The class is taught in python and focuses on basic object oriented programming skills. The files are either small in-lab assignments or larger out-lab assignments.
