"""
The solution does not produce correct output. The student put the advice in
the wrong order. For example, instead of:
--> visit your professor during office hours
--> visit your academic advisor
--> visit the EMPower Student Center in Roberts 313

it should read:
--> visit the EMPower Student Center in Roberts 313
--> visit your professor during office hours
--> visit your academic advisor

Also, to keep formatting consistent, the advice regarding minors should not be
capilized
"""


"""
To use comments more effectively, the student should comment each method
within the classes and give a more detailed description of the program in the
header.
"""


"""
One way the students' code could be more concise is by deleting the set_minor
method in the minor-classes.

Another way to make the code more concise is to entirely delete the
major_advising in the CLS_Major class, it is unnecessary.
"""


"""
One way to make the students' code more understandable is to define all
methods of the same type in a similar location in the Generic_Major class. The
student a reader and mutator method after some writer methods, which could
have been more organized.

Another option would have been to write another parameter into the constructor
of the Generic Major for the minor, instead of creating a seperate call for it.
"""


"""
One strength of this program was utilizing inheritance for the major-classes.
Instead of rewriting constructor methods, it just overwrote the get_minor method.

Another strength was the way the student created the enhancement. Other than, the
repetitive set_minor method, they were very efficient.
